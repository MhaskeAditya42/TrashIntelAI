# TrashIntel AI

TrashIntel AI is a machine learning-based waste classification and reward system that encourages users to collect garbage and keep their surroundings clean. The project uses computer vision to classify dry and wet waste, and provides rewards to users for their efforts in collecting and disposing of garbage. Additionally, users can send their location to the admin/garbage collector to request garbage collection.

## Features

- Waste classification: The machine learning model can distinguish between dry and wet waste, which helps users know how to dispose of garbage properly.
- Reward system: Users receive rewards in the form of points as they collect garbage. Points can be redeemed for various incentives, such as discounts or coupons.
- Location-based garbage collection: Users can send their location to the admin/garbage collector to request garbage collection. This helps ensure that garbage is collected promptly and efficiently.
- User-friendly interface: The application has a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to use and navigate.

## Technologies Used

- Machine learning: The waste classification model is built using TensorFlow and trained on a dataset of images of dry and wet waste.
- Android development: The application is built for Android devices using Java programming language and Android Studio.
- Firebase: The project uses Firebase Authentication for user authentication, Firebase Firestore for database management, and Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/MhaskeAditya42/TrashIntelAI.git`.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Set up a Firebase project and add the Firebase configuration files to the app (see Firebase documentation for details).
4. Build and run the application on an Android device or emulator.
